1, When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    
    sometimes we will write code using different computers, or we work as a team, somebody else may want to modify the code, 
    using remote repository allows us all to see the latest version of code


2, Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    pull manually could avoid confliction if many people on modify the same part of the code at the same time

3, Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork: is like a clone but only work between github
    clone: is used to copy repository from github to local, or copy between local, clone works on any repository
    branch: is created on one repository

4, What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so we can work offline

5, How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    using email, or google doc if without using git or github. for writing code require running and testing, git and github is more easier, if just powerpoint or text then using google doc will be find

6, When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when we want to show our contributors what changes have been made, and after all agree with the changes then we can merge to master, this way also prevent bugs and resolve them quickly. directly make changes in master is faster if you are working by yourself.
